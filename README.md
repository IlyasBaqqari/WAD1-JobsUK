## Overview

This folder contains the JobsUK web application for the Web Application Development 1 coursework.

## JobsUK Web Application

To run the JobsUK web application, simply navigate to the JobsUK folder and open one of the `.html` files in a browser.

If you encounter issues with the Vacancies or Calculator pages, it is likely that you are experiencing **Cross Origin** errors. To remedy this, you can try setting up a local development server using an IDE such as WebStorm or Visual Studio Code.

Alternatively, if this is not possible, I have the project hosted through GitHub Pages. This can be accessed from the following link:
